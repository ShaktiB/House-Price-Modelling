[Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#contributing): This is the structure I am trying to
use for my projects based on a recommendation by a Senior Data Scientist at work.


## Personal Note
The purpose of this project is to further develop my skills in data science. This project serves as a starting point for a series of 
projects I want to complete to gain experience and further develop myself in this field. There are some core things I want to take away from
this project:

- Explore advanced regression techniques 
	- Research the theory 
	- Understand key assumptions 
	- Learn about the general processes 
- Brush up my data visualization & exploration skills 
- Learn more about best practices for version control in data science

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is create a model to predict the **sale price of houses** in Ames, Iowa; its an alternative to the common Boston Housing
dataset. The dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock, his guidelines for this project are available in the [References](References/) folder.
- Documentation for the different attributes in the dataset are also available in the References folder

**Project Objective:** Develop a model to predict sale prices for houses based on various numerical & categorical data
- Since this dataset is provides a good opportunity to investigate the properties of regression models, that will be the focus
	- In a real work environment, determining what type of technique to use beforehand is definetly not good practice
	
## Data Exploration

The training data consists of 1460 rows & 81 columns. 
- Based on the documentation by Dean De Cook, there are 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous features
- There are 19 attributes with empty/NULL values; the most being Alley (Type of alley access to property), FirePlaceQu (Fireplace quality),
PoolQC (Pool Quality), Fence (Fence Quality), and MiscFeature (Miscellaneous feature not covered in other categories).
